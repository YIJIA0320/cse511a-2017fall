# CSE 511A: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence – Fall 2017
This is the collection of class assignments for [CSE 511A: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence – Fall 2017](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/cse511a/) in Washington University. It is based on CS188 at UC Berkeley.

## Project 1: General search algorithms
### Goals
Help Pacman agent to find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently.

1. Depth-first search (DFS)
2. Breadth-first search (BFS)
3. Uniform-cost graph search
4. A* graph search
5. Implement a search problem *CornersProblem*
6. Implement a consistent, non-trivial heuristic for *CornersProblem*
7. Implement a consistent, non-trivial heuristic for *FoodSearchProblem*
8. Suboptimal search

## Project 2: Adversarial search

## Project 3: Reinforcement learning

## Project 4: Probabilistic inference
